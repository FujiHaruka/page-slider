        <p>Delores breezed along the surface of her life like a flat stone forever
        skipping along smooth water, rippling reality sporadically but oblivious
        to it consistently, until she finally lost momentum, sank, and due to an
        overdose of flouride as a child which caused her to suffer from chronic
        apathy, doomed herself to lie forever on the floor of her life as useless
        as an appendix and as lonely as a five-hundred pound barbell in a
        steroid-free fitness center.</p>
